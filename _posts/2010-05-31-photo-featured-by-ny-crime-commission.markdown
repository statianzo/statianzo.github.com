This past week I was notified about usage of a photo I uploaded to
[sxc.hu][sxc] years ago named *Underneath*. The
[New York Crime Commission][nycc] used it in a pamphlet named
[Guide to Juvenile Justice in NYC][pamphlet]. The photo is displayed on page
four.

[![Underneath][photo]][photolink]

The composition consists of an under-bridge shot taken of a boy; his head
appears to be hidden in sorrow or shame. The scene's backdrop of worn bricks is
representative of the state of his life, warn and in need of help. Empty
darkness to the right portrays the loneliness he must feel.
